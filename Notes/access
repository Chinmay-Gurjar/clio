Access Control
--------------

A system of access control (and management) is required.

The Catalog can only be modified by accounts
which have the corresponding permission.

A separate persmission will allow
the creation of Complex Components.

Viewing of the information can be unrestricted.

Integration with LDAP (for accounts and permissions) is highly desirable.
